Worked on HW 6 with consulting with Valeria, Davey, Matt, Sam and Sarah.
Assignemnt was to download and clean two data sets, then merge to make comparissions on making a linear regressions model
(OLS) that fits to the data points. With the domain of building energy, fitting a model is not easy as the data can be very scattered. Determining the relationship between causal or correlative factors can be a challenge.
