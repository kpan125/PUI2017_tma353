Peer review of Data Viz for iuk202

![](iukplot.png

CLARITY:

The plot has a clearly labeled title, x and y axis. The time frame and the unit of measure for the quantities (gallons per day for each year in NYC) displayed are clear. One note is the gallons per day appear to be an average per day for each year, making that more clear would be useful.

ESTHETIC:  beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?

The esthetic is simple, clear functional. There could be yearly tick marks to help idnetify interesting years between the major x-axis tick marks for every 5 years.

HONESTY: 

The plot appears honest in representing trends in water consumption. The figure could benefit from a trendline to show the decrease over time and perhaps the markers used could be larger to fill up the open space of the figure.
