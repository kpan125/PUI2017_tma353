Reviewing Tarek Arafat's work tma353.

a) Null hypothesis is formulated correctly

b) Yes, the data is sufficiently processed to get the average age of both female and male riders for the period

c) Due to the unpaired gaussian nature of the data I would choose to do the t test to compare the two data sets.

I think that there is not necessarily a big difference between the average age of riders by gender and this is corroborated by the analysis. By further analysis it would become clear that there is no **signigficant** difference between the average ages of riders by gender. I would suggest maybe tweaking the null hypothesis to "there is a significant difference in the average ages of men and women riders" or something similar. 

# FBB that is a good statement of the issue, but the Null should say the age is the same (or not the same) and the alpha significance level, stated separately for both null and alternative, takes care of tehe significance

Other variations to the questions could include:
* Difference in average age by gender above/below a specific age
* Difference in average age by gender on weekend and weekdays 
etc.

# Who says the data is "Gaussian"??
