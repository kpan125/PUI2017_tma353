**CLARITY**: *****is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?*****


The font and font size are legible, there is a title, the axes are labelled. 

I don't know if it is really necessary to use both the phrases 'Building Class' or 'Typology'. It would simplify it to use just one. 

The quantaties are the number of buildings

**ESTHETIC**: *****beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is 
"beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors 
chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? 
Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?*****

Because the units are so far from the plotted bars, it is challenging to estimate the values. Faint gridlines would make it easier to read.

There is a lot of white space in the plot where no bars are plotted or are so short there can be barely seen. It may be better to leave
out typologies that do not have material values, unless that it something that is important to communicate to your given audience. 

The plot uses a singular color for the plotting, which is adaquete and non-distracting. 

There are not any distracting elements. 

**HONESTY**: *****is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?*****

This plot does not appear to be deforming the data in any way.
